# Game-Template
This program was created mostly in order to work on my Game Template, but the program itself is a memory path program.  You will get to make a custom memory path in which you assign items in a memory list to places in the memory path.  The program will basically be a raycast minecraft where the user can create his/her own textures and paths.
